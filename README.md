# CrazyPinyinTRON

Crazy Pinyin is an ‘question-answer’ type casual game. Its goal is to establish a close relationship between gamer players and game developers. Game players get a good experience and actual TRX rewards by playing games. While game developers can invest in TRX to purchase in-game ads in smart contracts and get good traffic within the game. Crazy Pinyin is implemented based on the TRON blockchain, using TRX as an incentive within the game, and using smart contracts to ensure the openness and transparency of the rules of the game. Crazy Pinyin is made with Cocos Creator, which guarantees the cross-platform capability of the game. The current version is the web version integrated with TronLink. Laterk, it will also support the Android/iOS version.
